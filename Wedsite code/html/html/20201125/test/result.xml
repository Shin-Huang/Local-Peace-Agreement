<p>Kuala Lumpur, 19 December 2018 (UNHCR) - UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and the Bar Council (Kuala Lumpur) Legal Aid Centre (KLLAC) launched the first phase of a programme to provide legal empowerment for refugee communities living in the Klang Valley.</p>

<p>The Refugees and Asylum-seekers Legal Aid Scheme (RALAS) is the first of its kind in Malaysia, organised by the two organisations.</p>

<p>The programme commenced in October this year, and wrapped up its first phase recently in early December.</p>

<p>“UNHCR observed an increasing number of legal concerns and queries raised by refugees during our regular engagement with them,” said Caroline Samuel, the head of UNHCR’s Protection Unit in Kuala Lumpur.</p>

<p>“In response to this, we designed RALAS with the KLLAC to empower refugee communities with knowledge of relevant laws in Malaysia, including their legal rights and obligations. RALAS is also an opportunity for refugees to receive free legal consultations from trained lawyers.”</p>

<p>Since its commencement, three sessions have been held with over 150 participants from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar (Rohingya), Pakistan, Palestine, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. To ensure representation, the participants comprised refugees of diverse backgrounds, age, and gender groups.</p>

<p><img  mlibid="5c25bed34" src="/thumb1/5c25bed34.jpg" /></p>

<p>The RALAS sessions provided comprehensive and practical training on refugees’ legal rights and obligations under the Malaysia’s legal system, particularly pertaining to employment, family, Syariah, and civil law; and free legal consultation to individual refugees.</p>

<p>Zeeshan, a Pakistani refugee community leader who participated in the programme, found the training informative, in particular in understanding their rights when detained, and how to seek legal services. He added that due to the knowledge he learnt, members of his community have benefitted too.</p>

<p>“The information I received has really helped me guide my own community. I am the person who is in charge of going to prison and court to assist when my people get into trouble, so all that I’ve learnt at the training has been very important information,” said Zeeshan.</p>

<p>Zeeshan felt that these kinds of trainings need to continue, as legal information is important so that refugee communities understand their rights and obligations.</p>

<p>In preparation for RALAS, 30 lawyers selected by KLLAC underwent a Training for Trainers programme. The sessions were facilitated by senior lawyers of KLLAC in areas of criminal law, immigration law, family and syariah law, and civil law, and included on UNHCR’s protection mandate, the challenges facing refugees in Malaysia, and applicable laws that could protect them.</p>

<p>Collin&nbsp;Andrew, Chairman of the KLLAC, said that the response received from the participants of all three sessions, has been positive.</p>

<p>“During the sessions, the participants raised many questions on various practical issues that they faced - such as immigration issues, criminal matters, even issues related to tenancy disputes,” said Andrew. “We were able to provide them with the necessary legal knowledge, and what to do when they were faced with such problems.”</p>

<p>UNHCR and the KLLAC plan to start the next phase in 2019, including to expand to more communities beyond the Klang Valley.</p>

            <fulltext><![CDATA[

<p>LESVOS, Greece – Under a light drizzle, families from various war-torn countries stack duffel bags and battered cases holding all their possessions at the entrance to the Moria Reception and Identification Centre (RIC) on the Greek island of Lesvos.</p>

<p>More than 200 asylum-seekers are waiting to be transferred by boat to accommodation on the mainland. They barely notice the rain because they are so happy to be finally leaving the overcrowded reception centre, where they have lived since crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey months before.</p>

<p>Their destination is a former resort beside northern Greece’s Lake Volvi. The site, last inhabited by Yazidis from Iraq, has been reopened by the government to ease the pressure on the islands and provide people with suitable accommodation and conditions while their asylum applications are processed.</p>

<p>“I hope and pray that the situation at Volvi will be better,” says Mohammed Al Ahmad, 33, from Syria’s volatile Idlib province, as he helps his four young children, pregnant wife and elderly mother onto a bus hired by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, to take them to the ferry in Mytilene, the main port city of Lesvos. They spent three months in Moria.</p>

<p>With the approach of winter, UNHCR has helped the Greek government move thousands of vulnerable asylum-seekers from Moria and other RICs on the Greek Aegean Islands to better shelter. More than 11,000 people have moved since early September from the islands to reception sites, hotels, and apartments on the mainland. UNHCR, with funding from the European Commission, assists in the transfers by bussing people to and from sea ports and organizing ferry tickets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The constant power cuts and the humidity at night are intolerable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lesvos and Samos have been given priority for the decongestion operation over other islands as the RICs of Moria and Vathy are in desperate straits. More than half of all transfers have taken place from Moria. In December alone, over 1,700 asylum-seekers have been transferred from Lesvos with UNHCR’s support, after they were authorized to move by the Greek government.</p>

<p>Since transfers accelerated, Moria’s population has fallen below 5,000 for the first time since April 2018, but is still twice its capacity. The authorities have increased their efforts to improve conditions for those still waiting.</p>

<p>“Even though the staff [in Moria] are good and helpful, the situation is extremely bad,” says Mohammed of the overcrowded conditions. In September, when the family arrived, nearly 8,000 refugees and migrants were crammed into shelters designed to house just 2,000.</p>

<p>Without enough room inside the former military facility, many lived in flimsy tents in an adjacent olive grove. Despite recent transfers since then and some improvements, about 2,000 people – many of them children – continue to navigate through piles of uncollected trash and muddy pools outside their tents, amid the olive trees.</p>

<p>In recent weeks temperatures have dropped to single digits after dark and frequent rains have made life worse in the olive grove. Space there is precious, but also inside the unheated and often soggy tents where people sleep, eat, and spend most of their days, while it is also possible to move around the island.</p>

<p>Families huddle together, among their belongings, wrapped in blankets to keep warm. “The constant power cuts and the humidity at night are intolerable,” said Palestinian Ousama Ouda, who lives with his family of seven.</p>

<p>Mohammed feels lucky to be moving from Moria to the mainland after just 90 days. He knows that time is precious. In Syria, a bullet killed his daughter instantly. He still feels the pain, but now looks to the future.</p>

<p>At a busy intersection in downtown Kigali, Annick Iriwacu is meticulously going through her shop’s inventory. The Burundian refugee runs a small liquid petroleum gas (LPG) distribution store with her younger brother. Business is booming now, but things were not so rosy when she first arrived in the Rwandan capital three years ago.</p>

<hr />
<p>“Coming here was not easy because when you reach a place you are not familiar with, you can face a lot of difficulties,” says the 33-year-old mother of three.</p>

<p>In 2015, Annick fled unrest in her country with her husband and children, finding refuge in Kigali, which has been described as Africa’s cleanest and greenest city. Used to being financially independent back home, she quickly sought out ways of earning a living.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Inspired by Kigali’s reputation for cleanliness and the country’s switch to clean energy, Annick decided to start selling LPG. “I thought about it and I realized the vision of Rwanda and how it is clean,” she explains. “So I decided to go into gas. It required a lot of capital but I decided to try.”</p>

<p>A cousin referred her to Inkomoko – a local business consulting firm that works with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, to train and support refugee entrepreneurs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They gave me strength and hope to continue, because I was giving up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“They gave me strength and hope to continue, because I was giving up,” says Annick.</p>

<p>She got guidance from Inkomoko on how to register her business, pay taxes and manage her shop. She registered with the Rwanda Development Board and received a till number that enables her to pay taxes. She has grown the business and now employs five people.</p>

<p>Lydia Irambona, the Director of Inkomoko’s Refugee Program, says their approach is designed to help refugees like Annick build their businesses on solid foundations. “Our main goal is to help them increase their revenue, get more customers and understand how to do business here,” she explains.</p>

<p>As well as helping refugees become financially independent, the scheme has also resulted in a small but significant boost to the local economy.&nbsp;The programme began in 2016 and has worked with 3,300 refugees. In 2017, &nbsp;they trained 809 refugee entrepreneurs in cities and in camps, resulting in the creation of 2600 new jobs countrywide.</p>

<p>“We have seen a lot of difference in terms of confidence, feeling like they are living a dignified life and also the fact that they have been able to create jobs,” Irambona says.</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c234e733" src="/thumb1/5c234e733.jpg" /></p>

<p>Strategic partnerships with UNHCR and private sector companies like Inkomoko have shown their worth, and Irambona sees scope for more private sector companies in the city to support refugees, calling it a “win-win” situation for all. “Refugees come into the country with knowledge, skills and a different culture which could be of added value,” she says.</p>

<p>As of October 2018, the country hosted more than 150,000 refugees, the majority of whom (79 per cent) live in six camps across the country, while the rest live in urban areas. There are about 13,000 registered refugees in major urban centres such as Kigali and Huye.</p>

<p>Around 60 per cent of the world’s 25.4 million refugees live not in camps but in cities and urban areas across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Mayors, local authorities, social enterprises and citizen groups are on the frontlines of the global refugee response, fostering social cohesion and protecting and assisting the forcibly displaced men, women and children in their midst.</p>

</ul>

<p>Kigali is part of a growing global network of municipalities that are opting to embrace refugees and the opportunities they bring. From Sao Paulo to Vienna, these Cities of Light are giving hope to the world’s most vulnerable by offering sanctuary and the chance to become part of the social fabric.</p>

<p>In December, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi hosted the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/high-commissioners-dialogue-on-protection-challenges-2018.html">11th High Commissioner’s Dialogue</a> event in Geneva, this year focusing on the role of cities in protecting the urban displaced.</p>

<p>The Government of Rwanda, via its Ministry in charge of Emergency Management (MINEMA), is promoting refugee integration in urban areas in various ways.</p>

<p>“The Government of Rwanda is very keen to continue supporting refugees through targeted assistance which includes their socio-economic inclusion,” explains Veneranda Ingabire, Senior Manager of the Special Projects Unit in MINEMA.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The advantage of being in a city is that you have the opportunity to work."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such assistance is in line with the four commitments that Rwandan President Paul Kagame made during the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2016/9/57e2481e8/unhcr-welcomes-new-support-refugees-leaders-summit.html?query=leaders%20summit">2016 Leader’s Summit on Refugees</a>, and the comprehensive and inclusive approach formally adopted by the Government of Rwanda in February 2018, she adds.</p>

<p>The government’s strategy includes practical actions such as the issuance of national refugee identity cards to all verified refugees, conventional machine-readable travel documents, promotion of livelihood assistance, and access to health insurance and the national education systems.</p>

<p>“We are very proud to help our brothers and sisters from the DRC and Burundi, as many of us have been refugees not so long ago,” Ingabire says. “We will remain open to identifying solutions which will help them improve their wellbeing in Rwanda.”</p>

<p>For Annick, the support she has received has enabled her to provide for herself and take care of her family, and helped her to feel part of her adopted city.</p>

<p>“The advantage of being in a city is that you have the opportunity to work,” she says. “You can find opportunities, you can use your hands and market your business.”</p>

<p>Lilian Jamwaka smiles warmly at passersby as they stroll by her stand, where she has neatly arranged an array of products on a table. The shiny beads, colourful fabrics and silky scarves easily attract potential customers and in a span of ten minutes, she sells two items.</p>

<hr />
<p>“I’m glad to be here because I can exhibit what I have made,” she says. “It’s my second time to exhibit and I’m eager to see what I can sell.”</p>

<p>The Ugandan artist lives in Nairobi and is among 50 refugees who showed their work at a Christmas fair co-organized by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). The event is one of three exhibitions held to mark the festive season and more importantly, provide a platform for refugees in Kenya to make a living.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m glad to be here because I can exhibit what I have made.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“We support the livelihoods and self-reliance of refugees and this is one of the many ways we do that,” explains Midori Honda, UNHCR’s Livelihoods Officer in Nairobi.</p>

<p>She adds that a number of exhibitions are held every year around the festive season in partnership with other UN agencies and NGOs to help refugees have access to a wider market.</p>

<p>“Frequent exposure to local markets helps refugees learn market trends, meet customers and hopefully, sell more,” she explains.</p>

<p>In addition to organizing these exhibitions, UNHCR works with various agencies like the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) and RefuSHE, a local enterprise that trains artists, to market refugees’ products and find locations in commercial areas for their wares to be sold.</p>

<p>Alpha Mukangala, from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), lives in Kakuma camp and has benefitted from such events. The Congolese artist’s love for art began nearly a decade ago and he has improved his skill through practice, UNHCR-facilitated trainings and mentorship programmes.</p>

<p>As he exhibits at the Christmas fair, he reflects on how the exposure to outside markets has helped him grow.</p>

<p>“As refugees, we often struggle to gain access to markets outside of the camps,” he says. “But through such opportunities, we can meet other artists, potential customers and be able to network.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Through such opportunities, we can meet other artists, potential customers and&nbsp;network.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Kampala, a similar exhibition has also brought together refugee artists from the six refugee settlements in Uganda. First organized in 2017, the second edition of the Christmas market has seen more refugees participate, exhibiting diverse products ranging from leather products, wood carvings and baked sweets.</p>

<p>Joyce Mbithi, UNHCR’s Senior External Relations Officer in Kampala explains that the market is helping refugees have access to a wider market.</p>

<p>“It is to the refugees’ advantage to be exposed to these markets as they have an opportunity to sell their products,” she says.</p>

<p>Congolese refugee, Kasereka Positif, grew up watching his father make leather products back home in the DRC. Now living in Rwamwanja refugee settlement, the 29-year-old has taken up the skill. His stand at the exhibition is filled with various leather products.</p>

<p>“I chose to do leather as a way of earning a living,” he says, as he polishes a leather belt. “Its the best skill I came with from the DRC.”</p>

<p>A few stands ahead, South-Sudanese baker, Mbikoyezu Daniel Baptist has arranged baked goods on his table. He started baking when he arrived in Kiryandogo refugee settlement in 2017.</p>

<p>“I started my bakery when I saw women in the settlement trying to make bread in sauce pans using charcoal which is expensive,” he explains.“Today I not only have a bakery but a skills development centre for the refugees and local community.”</p>

<p>UNHCR’s Honda explains that another key initiative to help refugee artists’ become self-reliant is strategic partnerships and refugee-centered initiatives like <a href="https://www.made51.org/">Made 51</a> that connect refugees to global markets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We assist with access and marketing and this is part of our strategy to help them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“While refugee artists have the skill and know how to make products, they don’t often know how to market themselves,” she says. “We assist with access and marketing and this is part of our strategy to help them.”</p>

<p>Lilian took part in a 10-day training with Made 51 and can already see the difference it has made in her work. Her avid interest in recycling is channeled through her craft.</p>

<p>“Before the training, I used to use common beads but now I have moved to something more exotic,” she says, adding that she is now recycling glass, cow horns and bones.</p>

<p>“My most beautiful beadwork is made out of recycled products and this makes them more ecofriendly,” she adds.</p>

<p>As another customer stops at Lilian’s stand in Nairobi, she proudly holds up a glistening necklace. It looks like she is about to make yet another sale.</p>

<p>With their hands signing the words and music connected to their ears through cochlear implants, a group of Lebanese and Syrian children decked out in white shirts and Santa hats heartily perform the carols they have learnt as part of Lebanon’s first-ever Christmas choir by the deaf.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Cochlear implants make music sound very different. Researchers liken the experience to being underwater or in a tunnel. But these Lebanese and Syrian refugee children have stepped up to the challenge.</p>

<p>With melodies emerging from their devices and lyrics memorized by heart, the kids have spent almost six months practicing three popular Christmas songs: Joy to the World, Jingle Bells and Silent Night. All their efforts have ensured that, remarkably, they are able to sing together in rhythm and harmony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘’I am very proud of them. They are singing a melody they can’t even hear properly."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The choir is made up of 26 Lebanese and Syrian refugee children aged between four&nbsp;and 16 years. They perform under the supervision of conductor Pascal Khairallah, the artistic director of FAID, the Father Andeweg Institute for the Deaf, located on the outskirts of Beirut.</p>

<p>The children had to divide every word into letters to be able to pronounce the lyrics accurately. The outcome is nothing short of miraculous, said Khairallah.</p>

<p>‘’I am very proud of them. They are singing a melody they can’t even hear properly. It is like asking blind people to colour something they can’t see … so it is a great thing they are able to do it.’’</p>

</ul>

<p>Nine-year-old Ali from Damascus is among the seven Syrian refugee children performing in the choir. Born with a hearing impairment, Ali learned how to use his voice for the first time when he joined the school in 2012 and began wearing a hearing aid.</p>

<p>“I am happy to sing together with other children,” said Ali, whose favourite Christmas song is Silent Night.</p>

<p>Anxious to ensure that their performance was accessible to all who come to see it, the children insisted on performing one song with sign language.</p>

<p>“They asked to do one song in sign language, because they said: ‘What if a deaf person is watching us? We want to explain to them what we are singing’.”</p>

<p>Founded in 1957 by Father Andy Andeweg, a Dutch Anglican priest who passed away in 1999, FAID is one of a handful of establishments in Lebanon that offers specialist speech and auditory therapy. It welcomes Lebanese and Syrian children aged 3-18 with hearing disabilities, from different religious backgrounds. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, supports the school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“UNHCR supported Syrian refugee children at the school last year. This year they were able to support more. There are twenty-four Syrian refugee children supported by UNHCR,” said Gladys Shawich, fundraising manager at FAID.</p>

<p>The children of FAID are hoping to perform their songs to wider audiences next year, to demonstrate their resilience and show music as a universal language for all. For now, they hope to spread joy to the world through their voices to as many people as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year,” said Ali.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Lebanon – which currently hosts more than 950,000 registered Syrian refugees – played host to another Christmas choir featuring refugee performers.</p>

<p>In the northern city of Tripoli, more than 160 singers including persons with disabilities as well as Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian refugees came together for a performance designed to spread a message of peace and unity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The pain of displacement and the hardship I went through, I wanted to let it out in a beautiful way."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A local NGO approached UNHCR in early November looking for talented singers among the refugee community. “The idea was to be inclusive of everyone,” said Wafaa Khoury, the event organizer. “We want to live up to our humanity, to show that no geography, no language, no disability can stand between us as humans, God created us all equal.”</p>

<p>One of the performers was 18-year-old Sedra, from Idlib in Syria. She fled to Lebanon with her family two years ago, and began singing as a way to channel her emotions. “The pain inside of me, the pain of displacement and the hardship I went through, I wanted to let it out in a beautiful way that helps me get rid of this pain,” she explained.</p>



<p>Theresa, 16, is an Iraqi refugee from Qaraqosh, near Mosul. She said that during the past three years in exile, Christmas was often a painful reminder of home and happier times, until she joined the choir this year. “The choir made me forget the pain of exile. Here, hand in hand, singing together, we feel happiness and peace.”</p>

<p>Tents from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, have become symbols of the humanitarian response in refugee crises and conflict zones around the world. But this month, a UNHCR tent appeared in an unexpected location: Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>The tent was displayed in the Palace as part of the <a href="http://sustainable-fashion.com/projects/dress-for-our-time/">‘Dress for our Time’</a> project by British social artist and designer Professor Helen Storey of London College of Fashion, at the University of the Arts London. In 2015, she created the world’s first couture dress made from a decommissioned UNHCR tent, which had been home to a Syrian refugee family living in Jordan’s Za’atari camp.</p>

<p>Inspired by the tent’s history, Storey travelled to Jordan to find out more about the Syrian refugees living in Za’atari. There, she was deeply moved by the stories of conflict and loss that the refugees shared with her, but above all by the spirit of resilience and ingenuity that flourished in the camp. She began using her design skills to work with girls in the camp on producing LOVECOATS – garments which transformed blankets into coats adorned with recycled materials, beads and ribbons, depicting the girls’ hopes for the future. Subsequent trips have expanded her work to supporting innovative artistic, cultural and livelihood projects.</p>



<p>In recognition of her commitment, UNHCR and the London College of Fashion announced Helen Storey as Za’atari camp’s first ‘Artist in Residence’ at a reception at Buckingham Palace, the Queen’s residence in London, hosted by the College’s patron, Her Royal Highness The Countess of Wessex. The reception celebrated the College’s ‘Better Lives’ agenda, which seeks to incorporate sustainability and social responsibility within the discipline of fashion.</p>

<p>Through the ‘Artist in Residence’ project, UNHCR and London College of Fashion are seeking innovative ways to bring together their specialist knowledge to provide practical direct action on the ground to refugees. Collaborating with scientists at the University of Sheffield, this has included a project to grow tomato plants in recycled mattresses, a micro laboratory producing soaps and perfumes, and with leading couturier Elie Saab and teams from the London College of Fashion, an embroidery workshop. Each of the projects being supported by Professor Storey and her team are designed in close creative consultation with the women and girls in Za’atari, to ensure that they nurture and develop the skills that they brought from Syria.</p>

<p>Za’atari Camp is the largest refugee camp in the Middle East, hosting 80,000 refugees who fled the conflict in Syria. After her first trip to the camp, Storey said: “These are the experiences that make you question the purpose of your life. We have so much to learn from Za’atari, and design must find more creative ways to directly make life better there, because when you improve the environment, you improve someone’s well-being and their potential.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In a displaced life, <em>everything</em> changes, it summons the previously unimaginable out of people - forms of courage and creativity I have never witnessed before”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UNHCR’s camp manager, Irene Ormondi, said: “The collaboration with London College of Fashion, UAL, will explore every possible way to connect refugee women and girls in Za’atari, in the most efficient and effective means and through innovative projects to enhance their future opportunities.”</p>

<p>‘Dress for Our Time’ was originally illuminated with current and projected climate data from the UK’s Met Office – one of the world's leading authorities in providing weather and climate services – &nbsp;to highlight an issue of growing concern for the UN Refugee Agency: the role of climate change as a major factor in human displacement. Since its inception, the tent dress has been modelled at the United Nations in Geneva, at London’s Science Museum, and <a href="57729ac17">worn on stage at the Glastonbury festival</a> by UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador&nbsp;Rokia Traoré.</p>

<p>Over the course of 2019, Storey and her team will continue to find collaborative ways to empower women and girls in camp by nurturing entrepreneurship, creativity and financial independence through the lens of fashion.</p>

<p>“In a displaced life, <em>everything</em> changes, it summons the previously unimaginable out of people - forms of courage and creativity I have never witnessed before,” said Professor Storey. “We have so much to learn from Za’atari.”</p>

<p>Mohamad Hamza Alemam had never tasted German bread until he set foot in Björn Wiese’s bakery. From that moment on he was hooked.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Now a trainee sales assistant, the 23-year-old Syrian hopes to learn the secrets of German breadmaking and one day take them home with him.</p>

<p>“I love that there are so many different types of bread here,” says Mohamad, during a break at the Privatbäckerei Wiese bakery in Eberswalde, in north-eastern Germany. “When I go back to Syria one day, I hope to take a little bit of this German culture, this German bread, with me. Maybe I’ll open a German bakery there.”</p>

<p>It was two years ago when master baker Björn first hit upon the idea of training and employing newcomers in his chain of three bakeries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I love that there are so many different types of bread here."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“We wanted to bring people together through food,” says Björn, 46, who belongs to the third generation of bakers in his family. “Of course, employing people from different culture to your own can be hard work sometimes, but it’s doable."</p>

<p>Björn now employs ten refugees and asylum-seekers. Together, they make up a sixth of his workforce and among them are several trainees like Mohamad, who started out as a part-time employee.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to stay home alone and do nothing,” says Mohamad, who had applied unsuccessfully for many jobs before joining Björn’s bakery earlier this year. “I wanted to work so I could improve my German, to do something with my time.”</p>



<p>Although he has been learning German since he first arrived in 2015, the language barrier was Mohamad’s biggest challenge. He was afraid of making mistakes in front of customers. However, colleagues helped and his confidence improved.</p>

<p>“Having this work has completely changed my life,” says Mohamad. “Over time it got better and better, every day I liked the job a bit more. My colleagues are all nice and the boss is even nicer. They always understand what I’m trying to say and are always ready to help with whatever I need.”</p>

<p>Mohamad says it was Björn’s warm welcome and dedication to his staff that made him decide to commit more seriously to the bakery job. This summer, he asked Björn if he could progress to become a trainee sales assistant. Björn agreed, helping Mohamad to work towards a vocational qualification.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Having this work has completely changed my life."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now a full-time member of the team, Mohamad is learning how to run the shop and cafe, as well as the basics of breadmaking in Björn’s on-site bakery.</p>

<p>“This traineeship means I can build a life here,” says Mohamad. “It means so much to me to have a secure future.”</p>

<p>For Björn, seeing the difference he can make in the lives of employees like Mohamad makes all the hard work worth it. It is a message he would like to pass on to other business owners.</p>

</ul>

<p>“When I see how much it’s appreciated then I’m happy to do it,” says Björn. “Especially with refugees, because they’re looking to build a new life. When you offer people prospects you get so much commitment and appreciation in return.”</p>

<p>It is the commitment of business owners like Björn Wiese – as well as mayors, volunteers and other community leaders – that helps to promote integration in many parts of Germany.</p>

<p>“They are the driving force,” says Dominik Bartsch, the Representative for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, in Germany. “They do not concern themselves with the politics of integration but roll up their sleeves, speak with refugees as equals and offer tangible prospects.</p>

<p>“Every city, every municipality should identify such individuals and support them. They are the key to empowering refugees and enabling them to flourish, and to give back to the community.”</p>

<p>They are dressed in extra-large white shirts, black leggings and a rainbow of scarfs. Some of the girls cover their heads with veils, others wear beads, braids or colourful nails. Coming from 19 different countries as refugees or immigrants, the girls and young women who form Pihcintu choir may look very different from each other, but when they sing, they do it in one voice.</p>

<hr />
<p>“When we sing together, we sing as a family,” says Sara Ali, 16, from Sudan.</p>

<p>“Our songs are mostly about peace and making sure our voices are heard,” adds Fatima LamLum, 14, from Iraq. “Because we have a lot of stories to tell.”</p>

<p>34 girls and young women of Pihcintu choir recently broke the routine at the United Nations headquarters in New York with their cheerfulness and optimism. They were visiting the city to show their support for a new global agreement promoting more and better solutions for refugees and the countries that host them – an issue that is close to the hearts of Pihcintu choir members.</p>

<p>Their families come from countries like Burkina Faso, Iraq, Vietnam or El Salvador, where many fled conflict and persecution, and they found safety in Portland, Maine in the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our songs are mostly about peace and making sure our voices are heard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Pihcintu” is an indigenous word from the Passamaquoddy peoples meaning, “When she sings, her voice carries far.”</p>

<p>Becoming familiar with Maine’s refugee resettlement program is what compelled Con Fullam to found Pihcintu 14 years ago.</p>

<p>“When you move to a new country, the first thing you lose is your voice,” Fullam says. He wanted to empower those newly arrived girls to raise their voices and tell their stories.</p>

<p>“When you first move into a new place you feel lonely,” says Fatima, who joined the choir seven years ago. “This was like a new family for me because we got to connect about all the things we believe in together.”</p>



<p>The girls practice every Monday evening, but beyond singing together, they have established profound bonds.</p>

<p>“I can’t express how much I love these girls,” says Sara with sparkling brown eyes. “We see each other every week and when we don’t it feels like a part of me is missing.”</p>

<p>For many girls, the choir was a safe space that allowed them to better integrate themselves into the community – or even learn English.</p>

<p>That was the case of Nyawal Lia, 24, from South Sudan. When she first joined, she saw the choir as a space where she could “sing, learn English, get some free snacks, and meet girls from other countries.” 12 years later, the choir has become an essential part of her life.</p>

<p>Nyawal, who lived in a refugee camp in Ethiopia before moving to the US in 2001, now feels empowered to represent the needs of refugees in Portland and beyond.</p>

<p>“It is critically important for refugees to step up in our representation and for the receiving countries to recognize our contributions,” she says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When we sing together, we sing as a family.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The members of Pihcintu are between nine and 24 years old. As they grow up, the girls’ schedules often fill up with competing activities and it becomes harder for them to stay committed to the choir.</p>

<p>Of the over 300 girls who have been members of Pihcintu in its 14 years of existence, 100 per cent have graduated high school and 85 per cent have graduated college, Fullam proudly explains.</p>

<p>Some members remain attached to Pihcintu even after going to college, like Bridget Duong, who is 22 and the most veteran active member. Bridget joined the choir because she saw her sister was having so much fun. 13 years later, she is still involved and participates in performances. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“It provides an outlet to express how we feel and what is going on in our home countries,” Bridget says.</p>

<p>With songs like “We are family” or “This little light of mine,” Pihcintu brightened up the UN headquarters and expressed a strong message of diversity and solidarity.</p>

            <fulltext><![CDATA[



<p>As the fierce summer heat of Jordan’s northern desert gives way to cold winter nights, 44-year-old Hilal steels himself in preparation for his fifth winter in exile since escaping Syria’s long-running conflict.</p>

<hr />
<p>With rain and freezing temperatures taking hold, keeping his family warm and dry presents added challenges and expenses. Hilal consoles himself with the thought that nothing could be worse than the two winters they spent displaced inside Syria during the war, after fleeing their home in Homs.</p>

<p>“Winter here is tough, cold and costly,” he said. “But the winter in Jordan is better than the winters in Syria during the war. We used to collect wood from the ground to burn in a metal bucket for heating.”</p>

<p>Their current home is a single-storey concrete structure set in a dusty patch of wasteland on the outskirts of Mafraq, a city in the north of Jordan with the country’s highest concentration of Syrian refugees.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Winter here is tough, cold and costly."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no doors in any of the bare concrete rooms, while unglazed windows and holes in the flat roof let in rain and icy draughts. Hilal puts plastic sheets and blankets over the windows and doorframes to try to keep out the elements, but the family has only a single gas heater for warmth, and even that they must ration.</p>

<p>“When it gets cold in winter, I turn the heater on for an hour until I feel the room is warm, then I turn it off again for an hour to save some gas, because if not we will consume too much,” he explained. Hilal and his wife Nouhad bundle their children into extra clothes and blankets to get them through the long winter nights.</p>

<p>Like the vast majority of the 670,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, Hilal’s family live below the poverty line and rely on international assistance to survive. The 155 Jordanian dinars (US$218) in cash assistance they receive each month from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, barely covers their rent and bills, with nothing left to meet the extra costs of winter.</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c1b67464" src="/thumb1/5c1b67464.jpg" /></p>

<p>As a result, they are among more than 328,000 Syrian refugees living in towns and cities across Jordan that UNHCR intends to help this year with a one-off winter cash payment of between 200 and 340 dinars (US$282–480). Assistance will also be provided to 32,000 refugees from Iraq and other nationalities. The money can be used to buy gas for heating, blankets, and winter shoes and clothes.</p>

<p>Across the region as a whole, UNHCR aims to provide life-saving winter assistance to 3.5 million vulnerable Syrian and Iraqi refugees and internally displaced people.</p>

<p>Of the total US$180 million requested for this year’s regional winter response, US$148 million has so far been received from donors – including large donations from the United States and Germany. However, UNHCR is urgently seeking to fill the US$32 million gap to ensure that millions of displaced Syrians, Iraqis and others get the support they desperately need.</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c1b67064" src="/thumb1/5c1b67064.jpg" /></p>

<p>In Jordan, as well as winter cash payments to more than 79,000 families, UNHCR is also investing in repairs to shelters and drainage in Za’atari, the country’s largest refugee camp, a few kilometres outside Mafraq.</p>

<p>Hilal said the extra help at wintertime is essential for his family’s wellbeing, particularly his 11-year-old daughter. “Winter assistance is very helpful for my daughter Milyar. It helps us to provide … blankets and clothes for school to keep her warm because she suffers from asthma, and the winter weather is hard for her,” he said.</p>

<p>Unable to work or even move around the house freely due to injuries he sustained in Syria during their displacement, Hilal puts what energy he has into caring for his family and ensuring his six children receive an education.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My wife and I can bear this situation, but why should my kids have to suffer?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The problem is not this house, or even the winter. The problem is that our nation [Syria] is lost,” said Hilal, whose large frame appears weighed down by the strain of their circumstances.</p>

<p>“My wife and I can bear this situation, but why should my kids have to suffer?” he asked. “They didn’t do anything to deserve this. They deserve a better future.”</p>

            <fulltext><![CDATA[



<p>KUALA LUMPUR, 3 December 2018 (UNHCR) - Refugee communities and civil society groups in Malaysia came together in a commitment to protect women and girls against sexual and gender-based violence, in an event commemorating the 16 Days of Activism against Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) on 29 November.</p>

<p>The one day event held at the YMCA Kuala Lumpur, was attended by some 242 refugee men and women who participated in a series of seminars and workshops run by NGOs on issues such as understanding rights, self-defence, coping skills, and establishing healthy relationships.</p>

<p>The event aimed to prevent, mitigate, and respond to sexual and gender-based violence, particularly in transforming attitudes of men and women through education and empowerment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“Sexual and gender-based violence is a scourge that affects all societies. It is completely blind to class, to colour, to wealth - it has everything to do with being civilised and being a respectful member of the human race,” said Richard Towle, UNHCR Representative at the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>“This form of violence is supported by ignorance, indifference, and fear. The way to address it is through education, through not allowing the cycles and patterns of the past to be replicated in the future, and through the courage to stand up and speak out against violence.</p>

<p>Each of us has the agency to do something about this, and we all must take responsibility to make a difference.”</p>

<p>Towle ended his speech by leading the participants in a community pledge to end sexual and gender-based violence.</p>

<p><img  mlibid="5c19ed424" src="/thumb1/5c19ed424.jpg" /></p>

<p>During the opening ceremony, Yana* a refugee woman from the Yemeni community, spoke up against child marriage, and illustrated through a personal story the cycles of abuse, violence, and mental anguish that young girls go through when society sees them as nothing more than commodity.</p>

<p>“Girls are told from young to live a life that their parents expect. She can’t be free, because we are trapped by the norms and culture of our society that don’t allow a girl to dream, or to dream of being happy,” said Yana.</p>

<p>Hakim*, a Rohingya man working in ICMC’s refugee women’s protection programme, spoke about the role men play in empowering women, emphasising that both men and women must be engaged in preventing SGBV.</p>

<p>“Gender roles are constructed by culture and society. Understanding this, inspired me to change my own behaviour. I realised before I could create awareness on SGBV, my own behaviour needed to change. If my behaviour is inconsistent with my belief, how could I share this knowledge with my community, or convince others (to respect women)?” said Hakim.</p>

<p>Hakim spoke about how men needed to recognise women as their equals. For Hakim, this started at home.</p>

<p>“I was taught that housework was a woman’s responsibility,” said Hakim. “My wife worked like a robot, from morning to night. I regret not helping her before.”</p>

<p>Hakim learnt to cook and do household chores and childcare, so that his wife would have time to do her own activities like undergoing capacity-building training.</p>

<p>“I like equality. I want my wife to be my equal,” said Hakim. “I also teach my children that one gender is not better than the other. Breaking gender stereotypes must begin at home. This is a big breakthrough for me. And this is what I tell other Rohingya men.”</p>

<p><img  mlibid="5c19ed924" src="/thumb1/5c19ed924.jpg" /></p>

<p>The commemorative event was jointly organised by a network of organisations involved in preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence in various communities, including refugees.</p>

<p>The organisers were UNHCR, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC), Asylum Access, the Malaysian Social Research Institute (MSRI), Engender, SEN Master Academy, Global Shepherds, UKM’s Centre for Psychological Wellbeing &amp; Counselling, Tenaganita, and National Council of Women’s Organisations Malaysia.</p>

<p>Liberia-born Wilmot Collins first came to the United States as a refugee in the 1990s, and settled in Helena, Montana. After more than two decades working, paying taxes and putting his kids through school in the city, its residents elected him as their mayor.</p>

<hr />
<p>“Refugees are no different from anyone of you. Refugees – you’re looking at one. You’re speaking to one. We’re no different. All we ask is, give us that second chance, and see what we can do for the community,” he said.</p>

<p>Over the years, Wilmot and his family have given back to Helena. He served 22 years in the military; his wife is a nurse at the local Veterans Affairs hospital, and their daughter is now active duty military serving overseas.</p>

<p>“We’ve given tenfold. And we will continue to give. Because that’s us. That’s what we want. We appreciate our host country. We appreciate our second country, you know – and so we give back,” he added.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“All we ask is, give us that second chance, and see what we can do for the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Collins spoke on the sidelines of a high-level meeting in Geneva to explore the key role that cities and urban areas around the world are increasingly playing in giving refugees, internally displaced and stateless people&nbsp;that second chance.</p>

<p>A recurring theme taken up by mayors from Helena, to Quito, Bristol and Mogadishu taking part in the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/high-commissioners-dialogue-on-protection-challenges-2018.html">High Commissioner’s 11<sup>th</sup> Dialogue on Protection Challenges</a> is the positive contribution refugees can make to their adoptive communities, when given the opportunity.</p>

</ul>

<p>“Refugees can provide different ideas, visions, perspectives, and all that enriches the city. It fosters the diversity of a community, and therefore that provides our people with chances of steering economic development and job creation,” said Mauricio Rodas Espinel, the mayor of Ecuador's capital, Quito.</p>

<p>“I see refugees as an opportunity rather than as a threat, and I think that’s the way we should all look at them.”</p>

<p>There are a record 68.5 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including 25.4 milion refugees. Around 60 per cent of them live not in camps but in cities and urban areas.</p>



<p>Bristol, in the west of England, declared itself a "City of Sanctuary" for people fleeing violence and persecution, and strives to create a culture of welcome and safety for all.</p>

<p>“The thing we’ve learned by providing a safe haven is that if you do it well, and if you put a good support structure around it, win the support of the population and business and local government, that actually becomes an asset for the city,” said Mayor Marvin Rees.</p>

<p>“Having an international population in the city brings you phenomenal connectivity. And one of the points we’ve been making is that if we follow our populations to countries of origin, across the Middle East, across Africa, across South America, we’ll find economic opportunity there, opportunities to do investment, to do trade, and to do business.</p>

<p>“So it’s in our own interest, as well as creating a more vibrant culture – and when a place begins to access a diversity of thought, it becomes a place of innovation.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Having an international population in the city brings you phenomenal connectivity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Souad Zaidi, the deputy mayor of Rabat and member of Moroccan parliament, meanwhile said that refugees had brought benefits as they settled in the nation’s capital.</p>

<p>“This has been really very beneficial for the city of Rabat. Refugees and immigrants are now well integrated into society. They have the right to go to school. They have the right to public services. They have the right to health care. They feel right at home. Today Rabat is no longer a city people transit through. It’s a city that welcomes people.”</p>

<p>In Mogadishu, the Somalian capital emerging from decades of conflict, including returning refugees and internally displaced in reconstruction is key, the mayor, Abdirahman Omar Osman, stressed.</p>

<p>“It’s my vision to reclaim Mogadishu, and the glory it used to have,” Osman said, calling the contribution of thousands of returnees and forcibly displaced Somalis “key” to that goal.</p>

<p>“We see the bigger picture. They can contribute to the economic development of the city. They can help to get employment and creation for jobs. So we see them as a positive.”</p>

<p>Growing up in Bukavu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Bertine Bahige was studying hard to become a doctor. At 13, he had his life figured out. Or so he thought.</p>

<hr />
<p>Everything changed the day the Mai Mai rebel group stormed into his town in eastern DRC, going door to door to abduct new recruits.</p>

<p>“It was the hardest thing,” Bertine recalls with a broken voice. “Looking in your parents’ eyes and knowing that you’re about to be completely separated from everything you have ever known in your whole life.”</p>

<p>Bertine spent two years in captivity. He was horrified by how children were terrorizing each other. “You had to be ruthless to advance in the ranks,” Bertine recalls. “That is not who I am.” He could not stand the violence and decided to escape. “I knew this could be it, but I had to take my chance,” he says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I had been given a chance to live a new life and I wanted to get the best out of it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His flight took him thousands of kilometres away, crossing lake Tanganyika on a fisherman’s boat who kindly allowed him to board for free and hiding in the back of a truck full of dry salted fish. For three days, that was all Bertine ate. “It was my first gourmet meal in a long time,” Bertine says with his unbeatable optimism.</p>

<p>Exhausted and about to faint, Bertine collapsed by a tree. When he woke up, around him were people speaking a language he could not understand. He did not even know in what country he was. It turned out to be Mozambique. Bertine spent five years in Maputo refugee camp, managed by the UN Refugee Agency.</p>

<ul>
	<li>See also: <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2018/12/5c1810404/states-reach-historic-deal-refugees-commit-effective-fairer-response.html" id="article_seealso">States reach historic deal for refugees and commit to more effective, fairer response</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The young Congolese refugee was especially worried about continuing his education – there was no secondary school in the camp. After some interviews, Bertine was told he was going to be “referred for resettlement,” but he did not know what that meant.</p>

<p>Less than 1% of refugees were resettled to third countries in 2017. Thirty-five countries world-wide take part in UNHCR’s resettlement programme. In recent years, the United States has been the world’s top resettlement country, followed by Canada, Australia and the Nordic countries.</p>



<p>In 2004, Bertine landed in Baltimore, Maryland in the United States. As soon as he stepped off the plane, he looked for the skyscrapers he had always envisioned but he could not find them. A warm feeling grew inside him: “Now I am safe.”</p>

<p>Bertine’s first job was at Burger King, where he started taking out the garbage and progressively moved up the ladder to become a cashier. “I always challenged myself to the next thing,” Bertine says. “I had been given a chance to live a new life, to educate myself, and I wanted to get the best out of it.”</p>

<p>Juggling three jobs at a time, Bertine joined community college and would never miss a class. Since he did not have a car, he would ride nearly 10 kilometres on his bike to make it to evening classes.</p>

<p>Bertine did so well in school that he was offered a scholarship to study at University of Wyoming. He knew very little about the rural state and when he would tell his friends about it, everyone misunderstood where he was headed. “Are you going to Miami?” They would ask.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All refugees are asking for is an opportunity."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But soon Wyoming became home for Bertine. At university he met his wife, and after graduating in mathematics and math education he became a high school teacher in Gillette. He now has two children and is the principal of Rawhide Elementary School. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“This country took a chance on someone who had nothing, and it has blessed me to be who I am,” Bertine says. “I look at it as my civic duty, my responsibility, to give back that way.”</p>

<p>In a recent visit to New York, Bertine wore a black hat with yellow and purple stripes and two big Cs sewn on the front. It is the logo of the high school where he taught math for 10 years and where he still coaches after-school soccer. “I needed to bring something from home,” he says.</p>

<ul>
	<li>See also: <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/a-new-deal-for-refugees.html">A new deal for refugees</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Bertine was in New York to share his story at the United Nations headquarters in support of a new global agreement – known as the Global Compact on Refugees – aiming to strengthen support for refugees and the countries that host them. Among the solutions the new deal promotes there are more resettlement opportunities, like the one Bertine had.</p>

<p>“There is a misunderstanding on who refugees are and what they are asking for – all refugees are asking for is an opportunity,” Bertine says. “Sometimes we look at it as, ‘How much is that going to cost me?’ But we fail to look at it from the other side – ‘What can refugees bring? How can they enrich our community?’”</p>

<p>Because of what he went through as a child, Bertine deeply enjoys working with at-risk kids and is able to connect with them at a deeper level than a regular teacher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We fail to look at it from the other side – ‘How can refugees enrich our community?’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I understand where they come from, what it’s like not to have food, to think that it’s you against the whole world, to not understand English,” he says. “But I also understand that that’s an opportunity for me to show them that I got them, that we are going to work together step by step, that they can actually be successful.”</p>

<p>His former students often come back, even years later, asking him for advice or to help them with something they are struggling with. On social media, they are his biggest supporters and always share glowing comments about him.</p>

<p>At the Guggenheim museum, Bertine discusses an abstract painting with his eight-year-old daughter Giselle. The little girl sees a pink and yellow butterfly with its wings wide open, while Bertine thinks it looks more like an oyster. The former refugee rejoices at how art sparks imagination. “We can be looking at the same thing and see something completely different,” he adds.</p>

<p>Painting after painting, he embarks on conversations with his daughter to learn her point of view and answer her questions. Even as a tourist, Bertine cannot help being the teacher he is deep inside.</p>

<p>GENEVA – Cities around the world have shown vital leadership by welcoming refugees and giving them a chance to thrive outside of traditional camp settings, the UN refugee chief said today.</p>

<p>Opening a key meeting in Geneva attended by mayors from cities as widespread as Bristol, Gaziantep, Quito and Mogadishu, Filippo Grandi said cities were playing a leading role in the push towards a new approach to hosting refugees, based on openness and inclusion.</p>

<p>“We think that an inclusive approach, based on investment in education and employment, is a much better and more sustainable, more dignified, model that really gives refugees opportunities for the future,” the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said. “It is cities that are at the forefront in implementing these policies.”</p>

<p>Grandi praised the work of the assembled mayors and other local authority representatives from around the world in offering a fresh start to the forcibly displaced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We look to you to continue to uphold these values."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“These are all cities that have been really pioneering new approaches in terms of receiving, including and offering opportunities to people on the move,” he said. “I have the greatest admiration for those mayors, for those local authorities … that have taken a stance in favour of solidarity. We look to you to continue to uphold these values.”</p>

<p>Grandi was speaking at the plenary session of the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/high-commissioners-dialogue-on-protection-challenges-2018.html">High Commissioner’s 11<sup>th</sup> Dialogue on Protection Challenges</a>, which is taking place at the Palais des Nations in Geneva on 18-19 December.</p>



<p>Discussions are this year focused on the protection and assistance of refugees, internally displaced and stateless people in urban settings, particularly cities.</p>

<p>Cities are playing a growing role in supporting the displaced today, when around 60 per cent of the world’s 25.4 million refugees live not in camps but in cities and urban areas across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Refugees and migrants represent an opportunity for cities."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mayors, local authorities, social enterprises and citizen groups are on the frontlines of the global refugee response, fostering social cohesion and protecting and assisting the forcibly displaced men, women and children in their midst.</p>

<p>“Refugees and migrants represent an opportunity for cities,” said&nbsp;Mauricio Rodas Espinel, the&nbsp;Mayor of Quito, Ecuador,&nbsp;which hosts thousands of refugees, many from Colombia and Venezuela.&nbsp;“They bring different visions, perspectives and experiences that can serve as a tool for economic development, for social inclusion and innovation at the urban level.”</p>

<p>Marvin Rees, the Mayor of Bristol, a port&nbsp;city in the west of England, also sees refugees and migrants as an “asset” for the local community.</p>

<p>“We’ve got people working for the council at the moment who came to the country seeking asylum or as refugees, and they are making a phenomenal contribution to life in Bristol.&nbsp;And we want to unleash that potential,” he said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I feel surrounded by opportunities."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The emphasis on giving the forcibly displaced a chance to live, study and make their lives in cities and urban areas around the world was also welcomed by young refugees on the sidelines of the forum – among them Foni Joyce Vuni.</p>

<p>Born in Kenya 26 years ago to Sudanese refugee parents, she said the chance to live in the capital Nairobi has allowed her to co-found an organization linking unemployed youths to mentors, and opened up a world of possibilities.</p>

<p>“When you are in the camp, the name refugee defines you. But in an urban area, you just live like a normal person … it makes a big difference,” she said, breaking into a smile. “It enabled me to ask … what can I do next? What else can I do? I feel surrounded by opportunities.”</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c1906f03" src="/thumb1/5c1906f03.jpg" /></p>

<p>Since resettling to Sydney, Australia, in 2015, 25-year-old Iranian refugee Arash Bordbar has studied for a degree in engineering, and is also a&nbsp;youth worker helping newly arrived refugees to find their feet in his adoptive city.</p>

<p>“It’s given me the opportunity to contribute to society as well. I’m working, I am paying tax, I’m studying, and soon I will be an engineer building the country itself,” he said. “If you are allowed to be in the city you can actually contribute and really showcase your potential.”</p>

<p>The Dialogue began a day after the member states of the UN General Assembly agreed on a new international framework – known as the Global Compact on Refugees – that will transform the way the world responds to mass displacement and refugee crises, benefiting both refugees and the communities that host them.</p>

<ul>
	<li>See also: <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2018/12/5c1810404/states-reach-historic-deal-refugees-commit-effective-fairer-response.html">States reach historic deal for refugees and commit to more effective, fairer response</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The new global deal seeks to provide more robust support for the countries where most refugees live, and strengthen the shared responsibility to aid those who are forced to flee by conflict or persecution</p>

<p>The agreement also envisions more resettlement opportunities – such as through family reunification, student scholarships, or humanitarian visas – so that refugees can travel safely. It also notes that the voluntary return of refugees in conditions of safety and dignity remains the preferred solution in the majority of refugee situations.</p>

<p>It also calls for policies and measures that will enable refugees to access education and to lead productive lives during the time they are in exile. In addition, it aims to address the environmental impact of hosting LOCAL PEACE AGREEMENTSs.</p>

<p>Three months after she was raped by armed men while fleeing violence in South Sudan, Vicky* realized that she was pregnant. Even now, in the safety of Kyaka refugee settlement in Uganda, the memories are raw.</p>

<hr />
<p>“When I think about that horrible day when I was raped and badly beaten, I wished to commit suicide,” says the 22-year-old, cradling her 11-month-old baby with her left arm. “I wish I had died that day, but my son keeps me alive.”</p>

<p>In her right hand, Vicky clutches something else that gives her hope: an English dictionary.</p>

<p>“This dictionary is my bible,” she says. “When I want to shun the bad thoughts, I read through it and try to learn new words. I hope one day I will be able to restart my education.”</p>

<p>Vicky is one of over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees who have sought safety in six neighbouring countries – Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic – since the onset of civil war five years ago. Another 1.9 million remain internally displaced inside South Sudan. Now, amidst severe underfunding, many are suffering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Funding has struggled to keep pace with needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, together with UN and NGO partners have launched an appeal for US$2.7 billion to address the life-saving humanitarian needs of South Sudanese refugees in 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>“We cannot afford to ignore the tremendous needs of these refugee families who have been forced to flee the situation in South Sudan,” said Arnauld Akodjenou, UNHCR’s Special Advisor to the High Commissioner and Regional Refugee Coordinator for the South Sudan situation. “There is enormous potential that can be realized if donors can support the countries that have generously opened their borders and provide all partners in the humanitarian response with the necessary means to respond.”</p>

<p>“It is our duty to support them to live a dignified and fulfilling life,” he added.</p>

<ul>
	<li>See also: <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2018/10/5ba265274/campaign-aims-cut-rise-suicides-sparked-south-sudan-war.html">Campaign aims to cut rise in suicides sparked by South Sudan war</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In 2018, UNHCR and its partners received just 38 percent of the required US$1.4 billion requested to support South Sudanese refugees. Education, health and food supplies are all severely underfunded, exacting a heavy toll on women and children, who account for 83 percent of the refugees.</p>

<p>“The food and nutrition needs of South Sudanese refugees are very real,” said Allison Oman Lawi, the World Food Programme’s Senior Regional Nutrition and Protection Advisor, who joined Akodjenou on Tuesday at an event in Nairobi announcing the <a href="https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/67312">South Sudan Regional Response Plan for 2019–2020</a>.</p>

<p>Many mothers have reported that their children were abducted, or their husbands killed, as they fled. Underfunding compromises the effort to combat sexual and gender-based violence and give people like Vicky the support they need.</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c1914993" src="/thumb1/5c1914993.jpg" /></p>

<p>Education is also one of the acute concerns. Schools lack enough teachers, classrooms are overcrowded and textbooks are in short supply, leaving half of South Sudan’s refugee children out of school.</p>

<p>In Khartoum, Sudan, 55-year-old South Sudanese refugee Jacob* has taken the task of educating the next generation of South Sudanese children into his own hands.</p>

<p>“There are no schools for refugee children here, and parents cannot afford to send their children to the only nearby host community school,” he says.</p>

</ul>

<p>Jacob and four other teachers from South Sudan lead classes at a small church that serves as a school for refugee children in the area. Classes take place every day except on Sundays, when worshipers gather for prayers.</p>

<p>“Together we are investing in these children and their future,” says Jacob. “They have already lost their present and there is no point for them to lose their future as well.” &nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c1914524" src="/thumb1/5c1914524.jpg" /></p>

<p>The South Sudan situation is Africa’s largest refugee crisis. Children are worst affected, having in many cases been exposed to extreme violence and trauma, including the death of one or both parents. Many have become primary caregivers to younger siblings. Their future is at stake.</p>

<p>“South Sudan is at a turning point but now is not the time to relax,” said Marco Rotelli, Regional Representative for Africa for the International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA). There are signs of donor fatigue, but this situation requires all of our support.”</p>

<p>Johnny José Gonzalez wheels the dolly across the warehouse floor at Doxs, a logistics company just outside of São Paulo in the city of Guarulhos. He scoops up a wooden pallet lined with cardboard boxes filled with light bulbs, pumping the dolly’s handle up and down to lift the merchandise just enough so that he can secure it to the pallet with a large roll of plastic before it’s loaded onto one of the company’s trucks.</p>

<hr />
<p>The 50-year-old Venezuelan, who used to own a construction company, has been working as a warehouse assistant for five months, his first job since arriving in Brazil eight months ago with his son and son-in-law. The three men came from Cumaná by bus before making their way to Boa Vista, where most Venezuelans seeking refuge in Brazil go in search of shelter, food and work.</p>

<p>"Venezuela was falling apart,” he explains. “There was no work, no food, no medication. I had to sell everything I had — my home, my car — to be able to get to Brazil to take care of my family. I had no other choice."</p>

<p>The stream of refugees and migrants crossing from Venezuela to Brazil has increased exponentially over the last five years, with almost 200,000 arriving since the start of 2017. Of these, more than 100,000 have since moved on, leaving the current total in the country at some 98,000 with an average of 500 more arriving each day.</p>

</ul>

<p>Shelters in Pacaraima and Boa Vista filled quickly during the influx, prompting the federal government to search for new solutions that would allow more Venezuelans to be helped as they crossed the border, and give those who had already arrived the opportunity to restart their lives in cities across Brazil.</p>

<p>São Paulo is at the forefront of this initiative, which has already helped 3,184 Venezuelans relocate to 28 Brazilian cities. Well-known for its diversity after decades of welcoming refugees and immigrants, the megacity is now home to 532 Venezuelans who arrived by way of the municipal government’s partnership with its federal counterpart and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Both the companies and the refugees have taken this opportunity to grow and develop."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Gonzalez first arrived in São Paulo, he was given a bed at a shelter in the São Mateus neighbourhood, where the municipal government had prepared to receive just over 200 Venezuelan men. Now, the shelter is home to 164, thanks to city programmes designed to help the new arrivals regain their independence through language classes and work, giving them what they need to move into their own homes and make room for others who want to start over in São Paulo.</p>

<p>Gonzalez was hired by Doxs after signing up for the Trabalho Novo, or New Job, programme, which has already helped around 100 Venezuelans find work in São Paulo. He is one of 74 who have been able to leave the shelter and rent their own apartment.</p>



<p>“It shows that the best way to help somebody and to support somebody in a refugee situation is by giving them jobs so they can develop their own autonomy,” says Filipe Sabará, São Paulo’s Secretary of Social Development and Assistance, which runs the Trabalho Novo programme. “And we’ve had very good feedback from companies that have hired refugees from Venezuela. Both the companies and the refugees have taken this opportunity to grow and develop.”</p>

<p>São Paulo is not alone in its efforts to help the world’s 25.4 million refugees, around 60 per cent of whom live out of camps and in cities and urban areas across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>A growing global network of cities are opting to embrace refugees and the opportunities they bring. From Vienna to Erbil, these <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/cities-of-light">Cities of Light</a> are giving refugees the opportunity to apply their talents and become part of the social fabric.</p>

<p>Mayors, local authorities, social enterprises and citizens groups are on the frontlines of the global refugee response, fostering social cohesion, and protecting and assisting the forcibly displaced in their midst.</p>

</ul>

<p>On 18 and 19 December, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi will host the eleventh <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/high-commissioners-dialogue-on-protection-challenges-2018.html">High Commissioner’s Dialogue</a> event in Geneva, which this year focusses on the role of cities in protecting the urban displaced.</p>

<p>Among the barriers facing newly arrived refugees in São Paulo is language, which the city is also helping them to overcome. Portas Abertas, or Open Doors, is a programme that offers Portuguese language classes to newly arrived refugees and migrants of all nationalities.</p>

<p>For Eyad Mohamed Dabour, a Palestinian refugee and computer engineer who fled Libya five years ago with his wife and children, these classes have allowed him to feel like part of the community where he lives and have given him the skills he needed to open a landscaping business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Without these classes, I wouln't have my business."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The classes provided by the city are the best ones I’ve taken,” says Dabour, who worked as an IT teacher for 18 years. “They’re taught by real, qualified teachers and the classes aren’t too big. Now I can talk to my employees, my customers. Without these classes, I wouldn’t have my business.”</p>

<p>A civil engineer, Gonzalez is more than qualified to work in the company’s warehouse. He hopes to be able to grow within Doxs, something the company prides itself on helping all of its employees do, particularly those who come to it as refugees. It also employs two other Venezuelans and a Haitian, all hired through the Trabalho Novo programme.</p>

<p>But for Gonzalez, Doxs is not just a place to work. While his salary sustains him in Brazil and allows him to send money back to his wife, children and grandchildren in Venezuela -- who he hopes to bring to São Paulo in the first two months of the new year -- it has also helped him become part of a community.</p>

<p>When he first started his job, it took Gonzalez three hours to get from the shelter in São Mateus to work in Guarulhos. The trip was taxing, leaving him exhausted by the time he was set to start his shift at 8 a.m. But his colleagues had a solution.</p>

<p>One of them knew of an apartment available for rent nearby. Gonzalez couldn’t afford it on his own, so he splits the rent with José Alberto Sucre Bello, another Venezuelan working at Doxs, and his son-in-law, who works in a hospital kitchen. His commute is now just a 20-minute walk.</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c117c014" src="/thumb1/5c117c014.jpg" /></p>

<p>His colleagues didn’t stop there. They got together to help Gonzalez and Bello furnish their new home, each one donating something they would need: from a fridge and a stove, to mattresses and a table and chairs. New friends have helped out too – the shoes Gonzalez is wearing were given to him by a neighbour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I was given a family here in Brazil."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I didn’t expect to be so blessed, to receive so much affection and support,” Gonzalez says. “I was given a family here in Brazil.”</p>

<p>But Gonzalez and Bello’s Brazilian friends and colleagues insist they have gained much more from working with the pair than what they have given.</p>

<p>“I think we as a company have learned more from them than they have from us,” says Everton Freitas, who works closely with Gonzalez and Bello as operations manager at Doxs.</p>

<p>“We learn something new from them every day. They teach us about their culture, about being proactive. They share a lot with us and we’ve become better because of them.”</p>

            <fulltext><![CDATA[

<p>NEW YORK, 17 December 2018 – In a historic decision, the member states of the UN General Assembly today agreed on a new international framework, known as the Global Compact on Refugees, that will transform the way the world responds to mass displacement and refugee crises, benefiting both refugees and the communities that host them.</p>

<p>“No country should be left alone to respond to a huge influx of refugees,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “Refugee crises call for a global sharing of responsibility, and the compact is a powerful expression of how we work together in today’s fragmented world.”</p>

<p>The Global Compact on Refugees was agreed as part of this year’s annual resolution on UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. It builds on the existing international legal system for refugees, notably the 1951 Refugee Convention, and on human rights and humanitarian law. It is a non-binding operational tool to bolster cooperation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The compact is a powerful expression of how we work together in today’s fragmented world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After two years of extensive consultations led by UNHCR with member states, international organizations, refugees, civil society, the private business sector and experts, this new global deal will provide more robust support for the countries where most refugees live. It will also strengthen the shared responsibility to aid those who are forced to flee by conflict or persecution.</p>

<p>"In this world of ours, which often turns its back to people in need, that has shamefully politicized the pain of exile, that has demonized refugees and migrants, this compact, in sinergy with the compact on migration, can really represent a new commitment to international cooperation," Grandi said.</p>

<ul>
	<li>See also: <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/a-new-deal-for-refugees.html" id="article_seealso">A new deal for refugees</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This deal comes at a time of urgent need to address record-high displacement figures – over 68.5 million people have been forced to flee worldwide, including more than 25.4 million people who have crossed borders to become refugees.</p>

<p>Nine out of 10 refugees live in developing countries, where basic services like health or education are already strained. The compact aims to address this issue by providing more investment – from both governments and the private sector – to further strengthen infrastructure and the provision of services for the benefit of both refugees and host communities.</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c181b6f4" src="/thumb1/5c181b6f4.jpg" /></p>

<p>It also calls for policies and measures that will enable refugees to access education and to lead productive lives during the time they are in exile. The compact aims to address the environmental impact of hosting LOCAL PEACE AGREEMENTSs and includes promotion of the use of alternative energy.</p>

<p>The agreement also envisions more resettlement and other opportunities – such as through family reunification, student scholarships, or humanitarian visas – so that refugees can travel safely. It notes that the voluntary return of refugees in conditions of safety and dignity remains the preferred solution in the majority of refugee situations.</p>

<p>The new agreement will monitor progress through the creation of follow-up systems, including a Global Refugee Forum every four years at which governments will report and pledge on a range of measures – funding, policy, legal changes, resettlement quotas, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Resettlement gave me hope.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The refugee compact’s adoption by the UNGA comes days after an intergovernmental conference adopted a separate Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in Marrakech, which will be presented to the UN General Assembly later this week.</p>

<p>“Today marks beginning, not end of our work to respond comprehensively to the challenges that refugees and their hosts face,” said the president of the UN General Assembly Maria Fernanda Espinosa during an event marking the historic adoption of the Global Compact on Refugees at the UN Secretariat in New York.</p>

<p>“As of tomorrow, all member states, together with the society and the UN family, are called to step up our efforts and deliver. The 25 million refugees in the world today expect this of us.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We are here to educate people about what we’ve been through.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed stressed the importance of addressing the root causes of conflicts and other circumstances forcing people to leave their home countries.</p>

<p>“While we must respond to the immediate needs of refugees, this is merely treating the symptoms, unless we also deal with the root causes of the record numbers of people displaced by conflict and persecution around the world,” Mohammed said.</p>

<p>Bertine Bahige, a former refugee who fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and spent five years in a refugee camp in Maputo, Mozambique, moved the event attendees with his inspiring story of resilience and integration in the United States, where he was resettled in 2004.</p>

</ul>

<p>“Resettlement gave me hope,” Bertine said. “I was given a second chance in life, and I wanted to do something purposeful with that life.”</p>

<p>Bertine is now a cornerstone in the community of Gillette, in the US state of Wyoming, where he is an elementary school principal. Because of what he went through as a child, Bertine especially enjoys working with at-risk children and ensuring they receive the support they need to succeed.</p>

<p>“I knew the pain they were feeling, the pain of not having enough,” Bertine added. “But I also knew that if I can place that hope that was given to me, it can make a difference.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Today marks beginning, not end of our work to respond comprehensively to the challenges that refugees and their hosts face.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thirty-four members of the Pihcintu choir, refugee and immigrant youth from 19 different countries, closed the event on a high note with two uplifting songs.</p>

<p>“I think music is education,” said Fatima LamLum, 14, from Iraq. “We are here to educate people about what we’ve been through.”</p>

<p>The choir members, girls and young women ranging from nine to 23 years old, came all the way from Portland, Maine to perform at the UN headquarters to show their support for the adoption of the Global Compact.</p>

<p>Nyawal Lia, a 24-year-old former refugee from South Sudan, stressed the importance of raising their voices in the communities they belong to: “It is critically important for refugees to step up in our representation, and for the receiving countries to recognize our contributions.”</p>

<p>Bertine and the members of Pihcintu choir are examples of the kinds of solutions the global compact aims to strengthen and build on to ensure refugees and their host communities can thrive. Its historic adoption today makes its ambition a reality.</p>

            <fulltext><![CDATA[



<p>Driving through the undulating countryside outside Erbil in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq (KRI), on his way to see patients at a nearby Syrian refugee camp, Dr. Mohammed Issa is sanguine about the fact that any fees he receives will barely cover his fuel costs.</p>

<hr />
<p>“Money is the last objective,” he said. “I want to help Syrians as much as I can. They can’t afford to come and see me – they are poor. I do home visits because I can’t allow a poor person to pay for a taxi ride to [the city].”</p>

<p>A general practitioner who now focuses on physical therapy, he makes house calls to mostly elderly Syrians after a morning of appointments at a private clinic in Erbil. He gently massages his patients’ feet and legs before leading them through exercises that he encourages them to perform each day until his next visit.</p>

<p>What makes these particular doctor-patient relationships unusual is that Mohammed is also a refugee from the long-running conflict in Syria. Being able to practice medicine as a refugee, he says, is testament to the openness of the city he has called home since fleeing Al-Hasakah in northeast Syria with his family in 2014.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The city welcomed us."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike many host communities around the world that place tight restrictions on the jobs available to refugees, Syrians living in Erbil and elsewhere in KRI are free to work, provided they hold recognized qualifications if necessary.</p>

<p>“The city welcomed us,” Mohammed explained. “They made it easy to issue residency permits… [and] allowed everyone to work.”</p>

<p>The Kurdistan region is host to virtually all of the 250,000 Syrian refugees currently living in Iraq. Around half of these live in Erbil province, with many gravitating to its eponymous capital, the region’s largest city and a bustling economic hub that radiates outwards from the ancient and imposing citadel perched at its centre.</p>

<p>Around 60 per cent of the world’s 25.4 million refugees live not in camps but in cities and urban areas across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p>

</ul>

<p>Mayors, local authorities, social enterprises and citizen groups are on the frontlines of the global refugee response, fostering social cohesion and protecting and assisting the forcibly displaced men, women and children in their midst.</p>

<p>Erbil is part of a growing global network of municipalities that are opting to embrace refugees and the opportunities they bring. From Sao Paulo to Vienna, these <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/cities-of-light">Cities of Light</a> are giving hope to the world’s most vulnerable by offering sanctuary and the chance to become part of the social fabric.</p>

<p>On 18 and 19 December, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi will host the eleventh <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/high-commissioners-dialogue-on-protection-challenges-2018.html">High Commissioner’s Dialogue</a> event in Geneva, which this year focusses on the role of cities in protecting the urban displaced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They brought new cultures, new ideas, enriching the city in different ways."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The long-serving Governor of Erbil Province, Nawzad Hadi Mawlood, said the decision to welcome Syrian refugees was driven primarily by humanitarian concerns. But by allowing them to move and work freely, the city and its people had benefited in ways that would not have been the case had they been restricted only to camps.</p>

<p>“Those in the camps live off the assistance they receive, but those outside rely on themselves,” he said. “There are no restrictions or constraints on refugees’ labour. They are just like any other citizen living in Erbil.”</p>

<p>“These are skilled people who worked in various fields in Syria,” he continued. “They were an added value to our talents, they brought new cultures, new ideas, enriching the city in different ways. I thought it was positive. True there was competition, but there was no resistance from the local population.”</p>



<p>The city’s open approach was partly forged by its long experience of hosting large numbers of new arrivals. As well as welcoming more than 120,000 Syrian refugees, Erbil province is also home to more than 600,000 Iraqis displaced from other parts of the country during years of violence and insecurity.</p>

<p>An obvious beneficiary of this approach, Dr. Mohammed Issa says Erbil’s open policies have been of far more benefit to him than any traditional humanitarian assistance. He has been able to support himself and his family, without the loss of identity and status that so many refugees around the world experience.</p>

<p>“Aid does not need to be material,” he said. “If you don’t help me financially but allow me to move and work freely, I will be doing well. If I couldn’t work, I wouldn’t be able to live here, I would have to go back to Syria.”</p>

<p>When Graciela Sánchez first arrived in Las Delicias looking for safety, she only carried her two children and a small bundle of clothes with her. The armed conflict in Caquetá, western Colombia, took everything she had.</p>

<hr />
<p>In 2007, Graciela decided to settle in a hilly suburb of Cúcuta, all the way to the east of Colombia, because it was near the border with Venezuela. Back then, the Venezuelan side was bustling with business and many Colombians would cross the border every day to go to work or buy goods.</p>

<p>“We Colombians depended on the border,” Graciela says.</p>

<p>Today, the reality is quite the opposite. Over three million Venezuelans have left their home country. An estimated 5,500 cross every day to Colombia with the purpose of staying in the country or continuing their journey southwards.</p>

<p>Over 35,000 people enter Colombia every day through the crossing in the North Santander region, many of them Venezuelans looking for protection, food or medicine who then return to their country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We have become a family.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Cúcuta, the main city on Colombia’s side of the busiest border point, health and social service providers are struggling to deal with the growing influx of Venezuelans.</p>

<p>In an example of true solidarity, neighbours of Las Delicias suburb have opened their arms and doors to those fleeing Venezuela. 23 families are currently hosting more than 150 Venezuelans in the community.</p>

<p>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, supports this solidarity network by covering water and electricity costs. The families within the network identified this need as a priority to improve their life conditions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>See also: <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/5c136d834">Emergency plan for refugees and migrants from Venezuela launched</a></li>
</ul>

<p>“The programme in Las Delicias builds on five years of experience working with the displaced population in the neighbourhood, and it seeks to strengthen solidarity and to promote activities that benefit the community as a whole,” says Rafael Zavala, head of UNHCR’s office in Cúcuta.</p>

<p>Most neighbours of Las Delicias know very well what Venezuelans are going through – over 60 per cent of them were displaced by the armed conflict in Colombia and built this informal settlement they now call home. With the help of UNHCR, Las Delicias is today a legal neighbourhood of Cúcuta, which allows its community to access services and official investment.</p>

<p>“I lost everything. I arrived here with empty hands,” Graciela says. “After having been through that, I decided to open my door to Venezuelans.”</p>



<p>During her first weeks in Las Delicias, Graciela and her two sons, who were three and eight years old at the time, slept on the floor. The three of them got sick with dengue fever. “It was really hard in the beginning,” Graciela recalls.</p>

<p>A generous neighbour, Juan, offered her and her children a place to stay. A month later, she bought a small plot from him next door, and she started building her own house. She paid Juan back in small installments, since her salary as a part-time supermarket assistant was meagre.</p>

<p>Graciela made a promise to Juan: “One day, when you’re not able to work anymore, I will take care of you in my home.”</p>

<p>As more and more Venezuelans were arriving in Cúcuta seeking help, Graciela could not remain passive. She could see herself in them: “They are Venezuelans and we are Colombians, but we both had to experience the same: leaving our families; fleeing to look for opportunities; starving; and starting from zero.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I lost everything. I arrived here with empty hands.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jenire Rojas, 30, is one of the 18 Venezuelans currently living with Graciela. She arrived five months ago with her husband. Back in Tinaquillo, Venezuela the economic situation was so bad that they struggled to buy basic necessities like food, she says, and the family was starving. “The monthly minimum salary is not enough to cover food for two days,” she adds.</p>

<p>Jenire’s two children, who are 10 and three years old, are still in Venezuela. “I had never been away from my children before, not even for a weekend,” Jenire says. Her hope is to be able to bring them to Las Delicias before the end of the year.</p>

<p>“We came to Colombia looking for an opportunity we do not have back in Venezuela,” Jenire says.</p>

<p>Jenire and the other Venezuelans in the house are deeply grateful to Graciela. “She has been a great support for us, always telling us not to give up, to keep going,” Jenire says.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>One of the things Jenire values the most is how Graciela fully trusts them. “Because we are acquaintances, but not family,” Jenire says.</p>

<p>Graciela has only been able to find work at a Chinese restaurant three days a week and her salary is not enough to maintain the whole community living under her roof. She even went into debt to buy a new plot and build a secondary home to host more Venezuelans.</p>

<p>Being so welcoming to Venezuelans has cost Graciela some friendships. Some people do not understand why she is opening her door to strangers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We came to Colombia looking for an opportunity we do not have back in Venezuela.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The five Venezuelan families living in the compound show Graciela their gratitude every day. Even though they do not pay rent, they help her improve her house, a basic structure of naked red brick, and the two other small houses in the backyard.</p>

<p>“When we got here, there was no floor, the roof was falling apart,” Jenire recalls. They helped her with house repairs and about a month ago they installed gas. They regularly cook, clean and do laundry.</p>

<p>He is battling cancer and Graciela is taking care of him, as she once promised. “He is like my father,” she says. The Venezuelans in the house also keep a constant eye on Juan when she is not at home.</p>

<p>For those displaced by unrelenting conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) the makeshift shelters they now live in are a far cry from the homes they have known and loved.</p>

<hr />
<p>Divine, 21, fled her village in Djugu territory in Ituri earlier this year in February, together with her family. She shares a tent with seven relatives in a displacement site in Bunia, the provincial capital of Ituri.</p>

<p>"Our house has been burnt to the ground”, she says. “We saw it behind us as we were fleeing.”</p>

<p>João Sobral, a shelter expert with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency,&nbsp;working in Ituri at the time, recounts: “At the banks of Lake Albert I saw villages, where about half of the houses were destroyed. But in other villages, further away from the lake, everything was destroyed. Nothing was left, nothing!”</p>

</ul>

<p>Odette had to flee her hometown in Rutshuru territory in the North Kivu province a few years ago due to insecurity. She first settled in Oicha, in the Beni territory of North Kivu with her husband and two children.</p>

<p>“Life was good in Oicha,” reflects the 38-year-old. “We had our own house.”</p>

<p>But the family’s quietude was short-lived. Two years later, she was forced to abandon her home again, after attackers came in the night.</p>

<p>“We heard gunshots and fled but they had killed my husband,” she says. “They looted our home and burnt it down.”</p>

<p><img alt="" mlibid="5c1385533" src="/thumb1/5c1385533.jpg" /></p>

<p>The small family then moved to the outskirts of Beni. After only a brief respite, violence and insecurity gripped their lives again and the family had to move once more after another attack.</p>

<p>“Armed men broke the windows of our house and started chopping off the heads of people in the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>Like Divine and Odette, an estimated 1.5 million people have had their homes damaged or burned to the ground and their few possessions looted amidst ongoing violence in the DRC.</p>

<p>“Some of those forced to flee report entire villages having been reduced to ash,” said <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2018/12/5c1375904/unhcr-warns-massive-shelter-needs-dr-congos-displaced.html" target="_blank">UNHCR spokesperson&nbsp;Charlie Yaxley in a statement</a> earlier today. He added that in the two conflict-affected provinces of Ituri and North Kivu alone, an estimated 88,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged due to conflict.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Some of those forced to flee report entire villages having been reduced to ash.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the result of the latest of a series of assessments done this year by the UNHCR-led Shelter Working Group in DRC, to which several humanitarian organisations contributed data.</p>

<p>“Shelter is one of the most basic things people need when forced to flee their homes,” explains Sahdia Khan, UNHCR’s Shelter Coordinator&nbsp;in Kinshasa. “It means safety and security for people whose lives have been uprooted.”</p>

<p>Often forced to live in shelters without proper walls or the possibility to lock the doors, displaced people are at greater risk of harassment, assault or exploitation. Women and children are particularly exposed to sexual and gender-based violence&nbsp;while living in cramped spaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Ituri, recent weeks have seen renewed attacks by often unidentified assailants on military positions and civilians. “I remember these small villages were everything had disappeared. The attackers had also destroyed all the basic infrastructure, the school buildings, the health posts were gone,”&nbsp;adds João.</p>

<p>In the Ebola-affected area near Beni, North Kivu, more than 1,300 cases of human rights violations against civilians have been recorded in the last three months, including physical attacks, indiscriminate killing, pillaging and kidnapping.</p>

<p>Besides physical security, having a roof over their heads also provides displaced people emotional security and comfort.</p>

<p>“A shelter is first and foremost a home,&nbsp;” says Sahdia. “Having a place to come back to&nbsp;their families at a day’s end gives displaced people hope and a semblance of normal life.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I want to return, but I do not have the means to rebuild my house.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While in emergency situations in DRC, UNHCR provides materials such as plastic sheeting and matting that can be used to make simple shelters, UNHCR supports wherever possible more durable construction, using traditional building materials. Rehabilitation of communal shelters or construction of new homes is carried out with provision for materials and cash needed to re-build houses&nbsp;under&nbsp;self-help schemes.</p>

<p>Over one million Congolese are now estimated to have been internally displaced in 2018. Pierre Mugisa is one among many who are waiting to return to their villages or cities of origin, but have to wait as the situation is still unstable.</p>

<p>“We have been here for almost six months. Our children do not go to school anymore,” said Pierre when talking to UNHCR earlier this year, pointing&nbsp;at the hundreds of shelters with plastic sheeting at a site for displaced persons in Bunia. “At home, our houses have been burnt down. I want to return, but I do not have the means to rebuild my house.”</p>

</ul>

<p>UNHCR estimates not even one in five people in need will receive basic shelter assistance this year due to a severe lack of funding. Out of the US$201 million needed for UNHCR’s operations in the DRC this year, only 46 per cent has been received.</p>

<p>Returning home also seems out of reach for Odette.</p>

<p>“I would like to return to Oicha, but we sold our land there and insecurity is very high,” she said. “Here, we lack everything. Life is hard.”</p>

<p>TILLABERI,&nbsp;Niger -&nbsp;When militants attacked his village in west Niger, Al-Bashir Gamo Gamo’s peaceful life spent tending to his livestock was over.</p>

<p>“They kidnapped five people from my village who were later found dead,” he says, explaining how armed groups threatened the village members with death if they did not leave within 12 hours.</p>

<p>Forced to flee to the town of Inates, in western Niger’s Tillaberi region, Al-Bashir now worries about how he will provide for his family as he can no longer do what he knows best - herd his animals and cultivate the land.</p>

<p>“Nobody can sleep at night, walk anywhere or cultivate crops&nbsp;because of fear,” he says. “If you want to look after your animals, you have to go to the bush, but there, they can attack you.”</p>

<p>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is deeply troubled by ongoing violence in Niger’s border areas with Mali and Burkina Faso<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/5c122b944"> which has forced 52,000 Nigeriens </a>to flee their homes this year alone.</p>

<p>Cross-border invasions and attacks by militant groups in the Tillaberi and Tahoua border regions have forced many like Al-Bashir to flee for safety to other nearby towns and villages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Nobody can sleep at night, walk anywhere or cultivate crops&nbsp;because of fear.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The extremely volatile situation has not only caused new displacement but is also affecting 53,000 Malian refugees living in the region, some of whom are considering fleeing to other countries if the situation does not improve.</p>

<p>Some of the displaced report horrific violence unleashed by the militants involving attacks on villages, killing of civilians, kidnappings, razing of schools and looting of homes and livestock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It is safer to not have animals as you might be targeted,” says Al-Bashir. “But tending to our animals is all we have ever known."</p>

<p>A state of emergency, declared last year in March by the government, is in effect in the Tahoua and Tillaberi border regions, with large-scale military operations ongoing. However, the prevailing violence and insecurity is hampering humanitarian relief efforts.</p>

<p>Since October, the government and humanitarian agencies have attempted to secure certain zones to ensure distribution of aid but ongoing security threats have prevented humanitarians from reaching all those in need of assistance.</p>

<p>UNHCR is leading a coordinated inter-agency protection response to help those fleeing. It includes protection monitoring to allocate&nbsp;rapid assistance to those identified as particularly vulnerable and in need.</p>

<p>UNHCR is also working with local NGOs and a network of community groups throughout the country to provide updated information on the needs of displaced Nigeriens. Since January, over 375 incidents were reported through this mechanism and have been followed-up by UNHCR and partner agencies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"For us, it’s just a question of peace and security ... If we have that, the other problems will all go away too.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Despite grappling with violence and insecurity along its borders, Niger remains a generous refugee host country and it is now&nbsp;the first African country to incorporate the Kampala Convention - the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa - into domestic law,” said UNHCR’s Representative in Niger, Alessandra Morelli.</p>

<p>There are currently over 156,000 internally displaced people in Niger, mainly from the western border regions near Mali and Burkina Faso and in Diffa, in the south east, near Nigeria. There are also over 175,000 refugees, mainly from Nigeria (68 per cent) and Mali (32 per cent) in the country.</p>

<p>Despite increasing displacement and mounting humanitarian needs, support for UNHCR’s humanitarian response in Niger has been limited. Only US$54 million, accounting for 58 per cent of UNHCR’s funding appeal for the humanitarian response in Niger has been received this year.</p>

<p>UNHCR continues to call upon the international community to address the root causes of displacement in Niger and the region and to work towards peace, reiterating the need for civilians like Al-Bashir to be protected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Al-Bashir hopes that the situation will ultimately improve.</p>

<p>"For us, it’s just a question of peace and security,” he says. “If we have that, the other problems will all go away too.”</p>
