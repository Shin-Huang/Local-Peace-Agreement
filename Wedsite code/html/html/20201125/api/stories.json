        "<p>Local Peace Agreement: A publicly available written agreement between locally-based actors which addresses local conflict-generating grievances within a part of the wider conflict-affected area. </p ><p>This database lists all agreements included on the main PA-X database that deal in some way with local issues, in cases of local negotiation practices that are on the margins of wider conflict, or in cases of local/communal violent conflict. Agreements are collected from 1990 to 2020, with global coverage. This collection stems from the work on the main PA-X database and is not exhaustive of all local negotiation practices, since it only brings together documents which are written, formally agreed, and publicly available. </p ><p>The detailed database covers 25 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Middle East and North Africa, Europe and Eurasia, Africa（excl MENA） and Cross-regional five regions, with a total of about 286 agreements between 1990 and 2020. </p ><p>Agreement Definition and Status&Date</p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/StatusDate.png'></p ><p>The number of multiparty signed agreement increased year by year between 2014 and 2018, but decreased year by year between 2018 and 2020. </p ><p>In 2014, there were more multiparty signed agreements between groups than in 2015. We guess there have been some major disputes in 2015, leading to more conflicts. </p ><p>Agreement Definition and Status & Region </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/StatusRegion.png'></p ><p>In Africa and the Middle East, the main types of agreements are multiparty signed. </p ><p>The location of each country by longitude and latitud </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/LongitudeContries.png' style='width:100%'></p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/LatitudeContries.png '></p ><p>To have a thorough visualization on each countries that were mentioned in the local peace agreement in terms of their location determined by longitude and latitude, there are two graphs individually being visualized based on the longitude and the Latitude variables. As we observe from these graphs, the majority of the countries are located around the equator. </p ><p>Number of Different Process Types of Agreements in Different Regions </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/PT_Area.png '></p ><p>We could see different properties sum of agreements in different regions, we could tell the quantitative relations between them. We could see different regions have their different tastes of the process types, for Africa, Asia and Pacific, Cross-region they prefer formal structured process a lot, for Europe and Eurasia, their agreement are more like isolated examples, as for Middle East and North Africa, they prefer informal but persistent practice which means there are many evidences of clear cultures or practices of local peace agreements. </p ><p>Change on Number of Different Process Types of Agreements with Time</p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%204.png '></p ><p>We could see the numbers of these three properties show an increase from 1991 to 2019. It's very funny to see that the agreements all have one process type in some specific years. However, after 2007, this phenomenon tends to be rare. </p ><p>Number of agreements over time (excluding some agreements without a mediator)</p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%205.png '></p ><p>As can be seen from the chart above, more and more peace agreements have been signed over time, especially after 2013, the number of peace agreements has surged(The red lines represent the mean). What is the reason for this? Why was there a sharp drop in 2015 and what happened?Where is this growth specifically reflected and is it directly related to the mediator? </p ><p>The relationship between Region and Mediator type </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%206.png'></p ><p>As the chart above shows, it is easy to see that different regions do tend to have different types of Mediators. In Europe and Eurasia and Africa (Excl MENA), InterNational or Transnational Actors are preferred as mediators;However, In the Middle East and North Africa, Domestic religious organisations/leaders or other elder are more often used as mediators of conflicts. </p >"

        "<p>1.graph1 (sum of local peace agreements based on countries )and a.csv</p ><p>Africa and Middle East has the majority of local peace agreements. And I made a bar chart( a.csv) to see the distribution of countries. </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1.png' ></p ><p>In this graph I find Syria, Yemen, Libya and South Sudan each of which has over 25( including 25 ) local peace agreements. So I decide to analysis these countries. </p ><p>2.graph2 (number of local peace agreements in four countries in time order) and b.csv</p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%202.png'></p ><p>In this graph( b.csv ) I could see there haven’t been so much local peace agreements until 2011. In order to see it clearly how local peace agreements influence peace process in certain history events, I delete the data before 2011. As for why there is an obvious increase after 2011, I think it is related to Arab Spring, which refers to a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. </p ><p>3.graph3 (number of local peace agreements in four countries after 2011) and c.csv</p ><p>There is the sum chart from 2011-2020.( c.csv) </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%203.png'></p ><p>I chose the peak of these countries: 2017 for Syria, 2014 for Yemen, 2018 for Libya, and 2017 for South Sudan. After checking some news I found In Syria, they peaked at 2017, and the US announced the withdrawal in 2018. In South Sudan, they peaked at 2017, and they ended civil war in the next year. They both could be symbols of people appealing to peace and have peace at last. However, In Yemen, 2014 began to have a civil war is the same year of the peak. The same situation happened in Libya as well, they peaked at 2018, and wars began to be more severe in 2019. </p ><p>So for these four countries, the rises and peaks in the number of local peace agreements have different conclusions. For two of them the peaks mean the peace is coming soon, but for others, the peaks means conflicts are getting worse. These are two opposite conclusions, so I try to introduce more data to analyze. </p ><p>4.graph4 ( number of all peace agreements in four countries after 2011)and d.csv </p ><p>Then I’d like to see if there is any relationship between the number of local peace agreements and the number of all peace agreements. So I also introduce the pax_all_agreements data.(d.csv) </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%204.png'></p ><p>Comparing these two graphs we could see, the trend are the same, so we couldn’t draw conclusion on the relationship between the number of local peace agreements and the war processes, because maybe it isn’t local peace agreements influence conflicts, but other peace agreements do. </p ><p>5.graph5 (distribution of local peace agreements in all peace agreements ) and e.csv</p ><p>So, I made a graph on the percentage of local peace agreements. If the percentage equals 1, it means in the same year, there are only local peace agreements are signed. </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src=' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%205.png'></p ><p>We could see in 2013 South Sudan peaked at this point, and I find in the same year it began to the civil war, in 2014, Yemen peaked, and in the same year, it began to the civil war. In 2016, Libya began to civil war and the percentage of local peace agreements peaked. As for the peak of 2019, in the same year, Turkey, Israel and other surrounding countries involved in Syria war. So we could see peaks of percentage of local peace agreements usually mean the beginning of wars or a new stage of wars. </p ><p>I guess it is because at the beginning of a war, many citizens are pursuing peace,but there are not much consensus that the two sides could achieve. So they have to sign local peace agreements to seek for local peace. </p ><p>6.graph6(the percentage of local peace agreements with mediators) and f.csv </p ><p>Mediator plays an important role in peace agreements. Then I would like to figure the relationship between the number of local peace agreements with mediator and the number of local peace agreements. I also take the percentage of  local peace agreements with mediators. </p ><p><img style='width:100%'src='  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shin-Huang/Twitter-Bots/main/Data%20of%20Web/Separate%20Report_1-1%20%E2%80%93%206.png'></p ><p>We could see the trend is a little bit like the distribution of local peace agreements in all peace agreements, especially in Libya and Yemen. Then we discuss the factors influence the choices of mediators. </p >"
